Create NACHA files in PHP

Currently only supports creating a single batch of debit transaction (collecting money from customers).
If you need more functionality, I'm available for contract work at sparrish@nodeping.com

To use:


$nacha = new NachaFile();
$nacha->setBankRT('12345678)// Your bank's routing number
      ->setCompanyId('987654'])// Usually your company Fed tax id with something the bank tells you to put on the front.
      ->setSettlementAccount('44444444444') // Your bank account you want the money to go into
      ->setFileID('987654)// Probably the same as your Company ID but your bank will tell you what this is.
      ->setOriginatingBank('BANK ON IT')// Text name of your bank
      ->setFileModifier('A')// Usually just A - for the first file of the day.  Change to 'B' for second file of the day.
      ->setCompanyName('MY COMPANY')//16 chars - your company name
      ->setBatchInfo('Monthly Subscriptions') // Text for the batch
      ->setDescription('Subscription', '03/21/2012') // Description shown on customers statements and date of invoice
      ->setEntryDate(date('m/d/Y')); // The day you want the payments to be processed.


Then push in the customer payments.
Each customer record should look like:
$payment = array("AccountNumber"=>'1234567'], // The customer's CRM account number (not bank account number)
                 "TotalAmount"=>30.00, // Amount they are paying you.
                 "BankAccountNumber"=>'123456789', // Customer's bank account number
                 "RoutingNumber"=>'98765432', // Customer's bank routing number
                 "FormattedName"=>'Joe Smith', // Customer's name
                 "AccountType"=> 'CHECKING'; // Could be 'CHECKING' or 'SAVINGS' - customer's bank account type
// Add the payment
if(!$nacha->addPayment($payment)){
   // Error adding this payment.  Must be something wrong
}

// Generate the NACHA file
try{
    $nacha->generateFile();
    // Put the file contents on the file system
    if(!file_put_contents('./ACH_MyCompany_NACHA_file.txt', $nacha->fileContents)){
        throw new Exception('Unable to save NACHA file');
    }
}catch(Exception $e){
    // Something went wrong with the file generation
    print_r($e->getMessage());
}
